    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph1": "I'm an Automation Developer working on test and infrastructure development, with a focus on building automation that teams can actually live with over time. Most of what I do sits between manual testers, Cucumber, and full automation — helping teams move forward without over-engineering or unnecessary complexity.",
    "paragraph2": "Today, I'm a Tech Lead and Technical Manager at Bank Leumi, working on complex banking systems where stability and reliability really matter. A big part of my work is helping non-technical testers feel comfortable with Cucumber, improving day-to-day collaboration with developers, and making sure automation supports the team instead of slowing it down.",
    "paragraph3": "I care a lot about design and long-term thinking. Spending time on architecture, BaseTest structure, timeout handling, and clean OOP usually pays off later — with frameworks that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend. I like thinking a step ahead: how this automation will look in a year or two, how it grows with the product, and how to keep it useful as things change. Lately, I've been exploring AI-assisted testing, Playwright, visual validation with computer vision, and smarter ways to automate React Native apps without making them fragile. With 3+ years of hands-on automation experience and a practical, infrastructure-first mindset, I'm looking for places that value thoughtful engineering, real collaboration, and building things that last."
