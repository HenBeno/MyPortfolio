    "title": "About Me",
    "paragraph1": "I'm an Automation Developer specializing in tests and infrastructure development. I don't just write tests—I build complex automation infrastructures that actually scale. Think of me as the bridge between manual testers, Cucumber, and full automation, with a knack for turning automation into a product, not a burden.",
    "paragraph2": "Currently serving as Tech Lead and Technical Manager at Bank Leumi, I'm a key player in high-stakes banking projects where reliability isn't optional. I lead organizational change by introducing Cucumber to non-technical testers, improving collaboration with development teams, and delivering training that actually sticks. My approach? Stop and think about design before rushing to write code—because a smart BaseTest, dynamic timeouts, and clean OOP architecture make all the difference.",
    "paragraph3": "I'm always thinking ahead: how does this look in 1-2 years? How do we make automation a product, not just a regression runner? I'm exploring AI + Automation, Playwright, visual validation with Computer Vision, and React Native automation that's actually smart, not brittle. With ~3+ years of hands-on automation experience (but the mindset of someone with much more), I'm looking for impact, technical depth, and places that value infrastructure thinking over test-count metrics."

This project embodies my philosophy: automation should be a collaboration tool, not a barrier.",
